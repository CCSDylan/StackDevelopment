# StackDevelopment
WAMP software stack. This is a full stack development style project that will be created from the root to its core. We will design a website using html, js, and css technologies, then will be using Apache, next MySQL, and lastly PhP. While doing so, we will manually assemble and configure hardware to host our web server.
